# Intersection of Two Arrays II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return  *an array of their intersection*. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in  **any order**.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
- 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000

 

 **Follow up:** 

- What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
- What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
- What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

        freq={}
        for num in nums1:
            if num in freq:
                freq[num]+=1
            else:
                freq[num]=1
        lst=[]
        for num in nums2:
            if num in freq and freq[num]>0:
                lst.append(num)
                freq[num]-=1
        return lst
            
        
```
