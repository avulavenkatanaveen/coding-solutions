# Guess Number Higher or Lower

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked (the number I picked stays the same throughout the game).

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

- -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
- 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
- 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).

Return  *the number that I picked*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 231 - 1
- 1 <= pick <= n

```py
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        low=1
        high=n
        while low<=high:
            mid=(low+high)//2
            res=guess(mid)
            if res==0:
                return mid
            elif res==-1:
                high=mid-1
            else:
                low=mid+1
        return -1
        
```
